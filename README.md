# SVG Logo Maker

## Description

The SVG Logo Maker is a command-line application that generates custom SVG logos based on user input. Users can specify the color, shape, and text for their logo, and the application will create an SVG file with the specified attributes. This project demonstrates the use of object-oriented programming principles, the Inquirer package for user prompts, and Jest for unit testing.
